Much of the soft limestone has cultivation terraces and other taces of arable and may have been framed fairly recently, although present cornfields are only a very small part of the area.  Other rocks are less cultivated.  Short annual grassland (Stipa &c.) appeares to be serial to arable, at least in some places.

Pines.  Scattered throughout the area, mainly in N. Fawng slopes.  The best are near Anatoli, probably on Nagelfluh.  No old trees seen.

Anatoli.  Village apprently on soft limestone at the foot of the main hard limestone outdrop [SYMBOL].  Houses almost all of one storey with flat roofs, built closely against one another in agglomerations of 1-celled buildings, so that it is difficult to separate house from house or to identify farm buildings.  Streets very narrow with steps, few motorable, used by mules.  Buildings whitewashed.  Roofs of cement or sometimes beaten earth.  Numerous dried-up annuals.  Mainly [SYMBOL].  At least 3 churches or chapels, each in a small yard, mostly concreted.  Low featureless

[11038-11039]

buildings with 103 parallel barrel vaults.  Gable bell-cotes.  Vault and walls cemented over; no roof.  Gardens few: a few mulberries and other shade trees in the village.  Street plan appears to be of several very irregular but rougly rectangular blocks.  The village is surrounded by a highly-cultivated and fairly well-defniend infield.  Mrytle was seen only in one place (see map).

Geology.  Most of the area is soft limestone and marb, with exposures of conglomerate in the Cephala valley apparently haphazardly.  The hills are dissected by shallow valleys but on a less formidable scale than in the west range.

Hard limestone begins behind Anatoli.  Basalt occurs as pluds and sheets.  The former comprise:

[SYMBOL] (two, or perhaps one split)
Possibly one at 589027.
A [SYMBOL].  [SYMBOL] and pssibly another E. of the town (of [SYMBOL] 22).
Two, possible more, in the [SYMBOL] area (one being Hill 434) (of [SYMBOL] 21)
Several in the [SYMBOL] area

[11040-11041]

(p. 629)
These are all steep-sided crags.  Sheets of basalt, not forming crags, occur in several places on the S.E. slopes of the [SYMBOL] area (p. 629, 1034)

Basalt forms harder and more stable cliffs than soft limestone, but is often overlain by fertile soil.  Cliffs black, often weathering to red.

No evidence of recent serious erosion, except round the base of the [SYMBOL] plug.

Building construction:  At Anatoli mostly soft limestone.  A hut below Anatoli had a flat roof laid on pine jousts.  Principal joust a sizeable trunk (c. 9 in. dia.), very straight.

Animals.  No stock of any description seen.

July 1 (cont. from p. 699)
Banana growing.  ([SYMBOL] 36,37)
On a large scale in the Arvi plains, with small areas in the [SYMBOL] and [SYMBOL] valleys.  Planted in rows in shallow trenches to which water was admitted in spring (of Myrtos practice, p. 671).  Trees about 6 ft high, with up to 4 trunks c. 2ft high.  Leaves healthy, unaffected by

[11042-11043]

frost, remaining long entire.  Fruit now green and about 6 in. long.  A tthe end of the journey (roughly 435990)  I sat exhausted under a banana tree and was kindly given some fresh bananas by banana gatherers.  Though green they were excellent, with none of the objectionable taste of commercial fruit.  The friendly people were interested in my doings and refilled my empty water bottle.

Ground kept weed-free.

Cultivated areas.  The description of [SYMBOL] (p. 684) applies to most of them.  Apparent reduction of cultivation in the last few years.  No water seen except at [SYMBOL].  The [SYMBOL] valley is narrow and has a deep dry gulley of a king not seen elsewhere.  People seen at [SYMBOL] and [SYMBOL]; at the latter I was guided by a friendly [SYMBOL].  Fences of Spartium ([SYMBOL] 36)

Headland Savannalus ([SYMBOL} 354; p.690)
On level ground on the [SYMBOL] and [SYMBOL] ridges.
See p.
Grassland has a temporary appearence and much of it may be secondary.  No trace of cultivation boundarires.  Very flat.  Trees are all carobs, varying in size, the largest c.3ft dia. 

[11044-11045]

and very gnarled as well as wind-pruned.  They are all about 20ft high.  Apparently deliberately spaced out.  These include some of the most venerable carobs seen in Crete.  Soil appeares to be thin over soft limestone.  Carobs are now neglected and the fruit not gathered.  No young trees.

Olive cultivation.
Olive trees all middle-aged.  No scrub under olives, but often grassland like that just mentioned but taller and with more Ononis.  This suggests that olives were formerly ploughed under.  Trees now neglected and fruit often ungathered.

Gorge of Anvi.  Seen from a distance ([SYMBOL] 35) as a formidable slit in the mountains.

Lycum is characteristic of the little cultivated plains ([SYMBOL] 2).

July 3 (cont. from p.730).
Geology and scenery in the [SYMBOL] area.

Soft limestone and sandstone from rugges hills and low patched sands, seldom cultivated unless nearly level.  Bsaalt similar but with more woody vegetation.  Hard limestone has a considerable 

[11046-11047]

variety from Coridothymus heath to pine forest, depending probably on slope and history.  Cultivated mainly where level.  [SYMBOL] 17, 18

Note no terra rossa on hard limestone: yellowish soil, usually scanty

"Volanic" (probably basalt) forms good deep soils of loose texture, even on steep slopes.  Mostly steeply sloping and thus not arable.  Mainly under olives.  [SYMBOL] 16 (view of St Catherine's chapel with threhing floor from near [SYMBOL]), 21.  "Natural" tall scrub.

Schist similar to hard limestone, always steep, rather more soil.

Serpentine occurs in a block around [SYMBOL], with broad veins further E. The strata are nearly vertical and can be followed as they run roughly E.N.E. across ridges and valleys.  They have no effect on the geomorphology.  Serpentine is intercalated with [SYMBOL] and in one place there is a bright crimson vein presumable of hoematite.  Serpentine produces a deep clay {[SYMBOL] 23).

[SYMBOL] 22: village and orchards of [SYMBOL].  24: tall garrigue (p.728) on serpentine by the road to Myrtos; although of very small extent (a tiny patch in the corner of a field remains uncultivated) it is probably the densest scrub in the area.  Note there is hardly any litter even here.

Small quantities of litter were

[11048-11049]

found under pines.

Threshing.  A threshing sledge is made of wood with an upturned front edge.  The teethc are bits of old band-saw set in the underside.  A man stands on it and it is pulled round and round the threshing-floor by beasts.

Walls of Hercleion.  Apparenntly almost complete.  An immense unbroken wall about 30ft high, slightly tapering at the top.  The moat is about 30ft wide, and has water in part of it.  The W. gate (perhaps 19th cent.) is a huge round arch spanning the main road.  The S. gate is smaller, probably venetian, ina reentrant of the wall (now disused; the road enters by a ramp in another reentrant).  About hald of the town is inside the walls, the main exception being the miserable surburb of [SYMBOL].

Tamarisk.  Planted in sand near the sea a Myrtos and [SYMBOL].  They grow remarkably fast (p.859).  A green sp.
