[TABLE] Following two fine days,
the horse-chestnut just to
the S. of the pine at the
middle of the avenue on
the W. side shows slight
signs of wilting. The new
leaves are almost fully
developed. [TABLE]  [24 in Rishbeth

[TABLE] The above horse-chestnut
shows no sign of further
wilting. Its neighbour on [25]
the S. [!!!!] in the same row
has very small leaflets. Another
just S. of the great beech
in the S. part of the same
row, which has previously died
back at the top, is much
[TABLE] [37]

worse this year and slightly
wilted all over.
May 11.
[TABLE] No further change in
these horse-chestnuts.
[TABLE] Some of the trees in this
avenue, especially those that
have slight crown symptoms,
have slime flowing from
the lower part of the trunk.
May 12.
[TABLE] Three plants of "trumpet
vine" (a climber with 2-pinnate
leaves and leaf tendrils) were
bought in the market and
put out in a box at Leck-
hampton.

[TABLE] The gourd seedling has
two white patches on its
cotyledons----apparently
as a result of touching
the polythene bag in which it
was being germinated in bright
sunshine.

Madingley Wood (Educational
Association).
[TABLE] Much the greatest area
is pure mercury. Bluebells
are in scattered patches,
mainly in the new wood.
Nettles occur in large
areas, especially on the
W. side of the ride to the
S. gate. Primroses are
scattered in the S.W. field.
None of the [!!!!] wetter zones
is represented.
May 15.
[TABLE] Stellaria holostea occurs
by the road between Great
Eversden and Kingston.
[TABLE] Mercury grows in the
hedges along the S. part
of Crane's Lane (between Kingston

and Wimpole).

Eversden Wood.
Specimens:
Salix cinerea -- typical of
most of the Salix in the
wood.
S. cinerea x repens. S. repens
was not seen.
Quercus Robur
Carex riparia

[TABLE] This wood is very similar
to Hayley. Ther is somewhat
less standing water in the
wetter areas.
[TABLE] All the oaks have been
felled (1941 according to the
County Planning booklet).

in several compact areas.
All this has been coppiced
(apparently at the time of
felling the oaks) and is
now about 30ft high, forming
a much denser canopy than

[TABLE] Douglas with some spots and Cednus atlantica on compact grael over clay.  Trees very widley spaced (apparently through shortage of seed), well over 100 ft high, sometimes over 3ft diam., with very rugged bark (in the case of Douglas) and enormous knots where side branches have been trimmed off Cedars rather similar in habit but less branched below.
[TABLE] The understorey is rather copious: mainly beech, young Douglas, and Arnelanchier.  Occasional oak and holly.  There has been some thinning in


[7978-7979]

recent years.  All the understorey is spontaneous. 
[TABLE] The best trees (some with over 7 tons of timber) are at the bottom of the slope.  Those at the top are no longer increasing in height because wind blast attacks their tops.  A bomb crater was colonized by a dense stand of young Douglas until this was destroyed by heavy snow in 1963.
[TABLE] Juncus effusus is common on the ground.  Sphagnum occurs in flushes.  [SYMBOL] Psedotsuga.
[TABLE] Arboretum.  Also 1960.  Mainly conifers.
[SYMBOL] Pinus migra, and P. strobus affeted by Peindermium.
[TABLE] Polylnichum formisum and Rhytidiadelphus triqucetrus are abundant on the ground.
[TABLE] Epiphytes: Rhodendron on a big cherry.  Beech on a very big oak.
[TABLE] Abies procera.  One tree, well over 100 ft, c. 3ft diam.; trun with longitudinal cracks in bark, attributed to drought.
[TABLE] Thuja: a very large tree with several trunks.
[TABLE] Taxodium: a tree c. 80ft high, 1 1/2 ft diam.


[7980-7981]

On the bank of a stream.  Leaves not yet out.  No aerial roots.
[TABLE] Euphorbia amygdaloids flowers abundantly and is commmon here.
[TABLE] Blechnum is abundant.
[TABLE] Oak-beech woods.  Also planted in 1860 at rather open spacing.  Oaks poor, c. 80ft high.  No under-storey.
[TABLE] Lysimachia nemorum is frequent, especially on tracks.
[TABLE] A small herd of fallow deer was seen here.  They were very amenable and moved away slowly when approached by a large party within 50 yards.
[TABLE] Bluebell is rather scarce, mainly in hollows.

[TABLE] Mark Ash Wood.  There are four types of land use in the New Forest:
[TABLE] 1.  Open common
[TABLE] 2.  Ancient & Ornamental Woodland (7,-9,000 acres)
[TABLE] 3.  Inclosures managed by the forestry commission.
[TABLE] 4.  Private freeholds.
[TABLE] This wood is Ancient & Ornamental.  It is on rather damp ground


[7982-7983]

with much Sphagnum and Leucobryum especially in flushes and hollows.
[TABLE] Beech is the dominant tree, of immense height, usually with a short stout trunk and about 20 immense erect or spreading branches.  Most of the trees have a pioneer habit and were probably pillarded, a practice prohibited by Act of Parliament in the 18th cent.
[TABLE] Oak is less abundant but similar in size.  Not commonly pollarded.
[TABLE] Yew is frequent: usually small to medium trees.
[TABLE] Holly is characteristic and is about the only under-storey tree, usually in small groups, and copses.  Sometimes quite a large tree.  It is a food of deer.  The bark is commonly streipped off by fellow stags.  Trees are felled in hard winter weather to provide brooze for the deer (as was formerly beech in dry summers).
[TABLE] In one flush, Sphagmum (including [SYMBOL] rubellum), Polytrichurn commune, Vaccinium myrtillus, and Erica tetralix are dominant Oak regenerates freely in this area.


[7984-7985]

Oxalis is abundant on the ground in drier areas.  
Hypnum cupresosiforme is about the only epiphyte on beech.
Beech regenerates only under protection from grazing, for instance in holly thickets.
Beeches are said to live for c.250 years, oaks c. 350 years.  The exact ages are indeterminate because no trees are allowed to be felled unless rotten.  ost of the trees that die are hollow.  Armillaria is a common cause of death.

[TABLE] Until recently, no felling, inclosing, or planting were allowed in these woods.  An Act of 1949 was designed to permit articifical regeneration in isolated blocks of not more than 20 acres.  In 1951, two clearings were made and fenced in a good most year.  These are now a dense growth of pole beech [SYMBOL], but the surrounding trees have been damaged by wind wffeccts in the gap.  To prevent this from recurring, enclosures are now made in natural gaps.  Trees are usually self-sown, but planting is 


[7986-7987]

necessary in areas of btacken; in such places both oak and beech are put in.  Single trees are also planted.
[TABLE] This part of the forest is chiefly of interest for organisms living in rotten trees: wood-eating beetles of national interest, and hole-nesting birds, hornets' nests are frequent.
[TABLE] Yew is eaten by deer and commoners' animals [SYMBOL]/  They are very rarely poisoned, unless driven to eat too much.
[TABLE] Ivy is very scarce, except in the crowns of trees, as deer are partial to the foliage.
[TABLE] Hylocomium splendens so local.
[TABLE] One beech tree has a branch which comes down to the ground and has rooted to form a nearly independent tree - a very rare occurence.  It is about to repeat this.

[TABLE] Oakley Inclosure.  A Forestry Commission inclosure with a great variety of crops and practices.
A small herd (c.20) of fallow deer was seen here.  Similarly very tame.  They included a white doe and fawn.
Fallow deer are the most numerous.  White ones are 


[7988-7989]

frequent: numbers of male and female are about equal, but their mothers are usually brown.  Red deer are very few.  Roe were absent in the Middle Ages.  Since 1900, their numbers have been increasing, despite losses of 30% annually by lung-worms, and killing by foxes and dogs.  Lasts year, the deer were numbered and a big shoot was held, the weaker individuals being killed.  20-30 sika were killed annually.

[TABLE] Deer paching is done by a few skilled locals with guns, by gipsies with snares, and townspeople with guns.  When snares are found, either there is an ambush laid dor the setter, or the snare is cut and arranged so that it looks as if still set.  Redicularis palustrio and Ruscus are found in this area.

[TABLE] Bracken is patchy, and has been recently slightly frosted in hollows in this area.
[TABLE] Beech mast is produced in small quantities in one year in four.
[TABLE] Acorns are produced one year in two.  In 1964, animals died of excess of acorns.
[TABLE] Tsuga is suceeding on a waterlogged clay.
[TABLE] Poplars have been tried unsuccessively on wet ground in the Bratley valley.


[7990-7991]

Felling of conifers is done in hollow squares with 20 standards per acre to provide seed for the next crop and to encourage crossbills.
[TABLE] Woodcock and snepe have not recovered from the setback of the 1963 winter.
[TABLE] Fomes is not important.
[TABLE] The deer eat the outer bark of mountain ash, but only where it occurs in open stands.  This is probably an individual idiosyncracy.  It does not harm the tree.
[TABLE] Boldenwood farm.  This is a small enclosed area of grassland.  Deer have always fed on the fields, but the present tenant has encouraged them in the past two years and has prohibited shooting and distubrance.  There is now a resident herd of about 40 fallow deer (all bucks_ which spend most of their time here.  About 20 of these deer were seen about 70 yards away.  They were quite unconcerned when a large crowed looked at them through a narrow belt.  When met in the forest, the same animals are less tame.  They included Jimmy, a white buck of great size, 9 years old.
[TABLE] Bushy Bratley.  A mosaic of open Calluna heath with occasional bushes, 


[7992-7993]

and patches of dense holly scrub.
[TABLE] Frangula (not Rhammuo) occurs on the apprently dry health, mainly isolated.
[TABLE] The scrub grows about 20ft high.  It consists mainly of holly bushes and small trees, but with much yew and mountain ash.  Pine shows little tendency to invade.
[TABLE] A witches'-brrom was seen surrounding a tall Douglas nea tthe top. [DIAG]
[TABLE] Someof the big Douglases have been felled.  One log measured 74 "ft" long x 2'10" at the large end.  106 years old.  Enormous live and dead knots.

[TABLE] May 21.  Linden Hall Hydro Bornemouth
[TABLE] Brownsea Island.  (Bryophytes p.8009) The northern part of the island, the Nature Reserve, was perambulated.
[TABLE] The marsh at the E. end was inclosed by a wall erected by Waugh in the 1850s as a preliminary to digging for the china clay which he supposed to lie under the sea.  It has now long been derelict and is mainly saltings.  This is the most interesting part as


[7994-7995]

a bird sanctuary.
[TABLE] Canada geese and goslings were seen in the saltings.
[TABLE] There is a big fresh marsh, much invaded by alder and birch, running inland between the church and the villa.
[TABLE] There are giant elmo around the village.
[TABLE] Birds on the saltings can be seen watched from a public hide (on the boundary of the reserve) with slot-machine binoculars run by a commercial firm.
[TABLE] Terms nest on artificial islands which have been built of logs and gravel in the salt marsh.
[TABLE] Oxford Wood (to the N. of the villa) is a tall wood of Pinus maritime and other pines which escaped the great fire of 1936.  It contains about 70 herons' nests like big rooks' nests in the upper branches.
[TABLE] There are a few big Arbutus trees in this wood, to 25 ft high.
[TABLE] The remainder of the reserve (N. of the main E.-W. path) was formerly high forest but was burnt out in 1936.  A very few living trees, all Pinus maritima, without lower branches, remain on spurs between gullies on the N. side.  Many of those that were killed

[7996]

still stand; the sap wood has become eroded to an alarming extent near the base, but the tough heart-wood supports the weight of the trunk. [DIAG]

[TABLE] In place of the forest, there is a dense stand of young pines (P. maritina syvestris radiata) c. 30ft high.  There are a few yews and young oaks.  Rhododendron forms dense thickets over large areas, growing 20ft high, and largely excluding pines and other vegetation.  Birch is freqent; bracken locally dominant.  Cladonia syvatica occurs locally.
