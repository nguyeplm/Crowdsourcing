November 30.  "[SYMBOL]"
Hayley Wood.
Visited with Abbotsley [????]
District Pigeon [????] Rabbit Clearance
Society's chairman, Mr Sharp, and 
Mr Cooper, of Pest Control Services.
We met Mr Cox, who reported 
damage to crops by rabbits 
leaving the wood on the W. and 
S.W. sides.
We inspected the whole of 
the boundary on the N. and 
W. sides and the W. half of 
the S. side.
Rabbit holes are numerous 
on the W. and S. sides in the 
low bank formed by turning
the earth from the boundary
ditch into the wood.
On the N. side, we found


[7638-7639]
recent holes visible from the rail-
way, but there were signs that
rabbits did emerge from the wood
on this side, though not to any
great extent.
In the interior of the wood,
we found no holes, apart from a 
few in the banks around Hay-
L[????]y Lane. The water level is now
high and rising fast, and most
of the area will soon be unin-
habitable.

Under the great oak which
stands just outside the wood
in the middle of the S.side, we
found a paunch which we a-
greed was that of a fallow 
deer slain within the week. Near-
by, we foudn two deer snares.
one set in such a way as to
catch a deer as it left the
wood and jumped the ditch.
Some blood on the logs in the
bottom of the ditch showed that
one had already been killed there.
The snares were impounded.
They consist of a running 
noose of stout 4-strand
galvanized fence-wire formed
into a circle about 2ft diam.
and propped up in a vertical
plane. The end of the wire
is made fast to a stout
log. One was fitted with a 
swivel.
Mr Cooper says he has seen 
muntjac tracks in the wood.

Funaria hygrometrica occurs


[7640-7641]
in dense stands on bonfire
sites of the 1965 plot.
An oak in the middle 
of the N.quarter has been
snapped off about half-way
up recently. It was brown-
-rotted in the heart.
Mnium undulatum is 
rather scattered and local in 
the N. quarter.

Pleurotus cornucopioides. Still flour-
ishing on an elm log.

December 1.
Mnium undulatum is very
local in Madingley Wood: it
forms dense patches under
spruces near the middle of 
the "pan-handle" and scattered
tufts occur on the ride
leading down to the latter
from the Coton gate.
December 2.
The following mosses were
plasmolyzed:
Mnium undulatum,
Eurhynchium swartzii,
Funaria hygrometrica,
Rhytidiadelphus squamosus.
All went at about 1M 1½M
in potassium chloride, but sucrose
had no effect even at 2½M. There
was no sign of recovery. LiCl
had much the same effect as
KCl; CaCl2 caused prosenchy-
matous cells to plasmolyze
from the sides as distinct from
the ends as with KCl; ethylene
glucol had no effect. In some,


[7642-7643]
such as the Rhytidiadelphus,
there is much variation between
the middle, the wings, tip,
base, and auricles. The [!!!!]suction[!!!!] osmotic
pressure may be increased
by about ½osm. by leaving
the moss in a covered dish
exposed to sunlight for a day.
[Diag]

December 3.
The youngest sporophores of 
the great ring of Clitocybe nebularis
at Madingley Wood are still
mature.
December 4.
Rhytidiadelphus squamosus
is very abundant from end to
end of Le[????]champton, coming
up into the terrace lawn in front
of the house (thought not
apparently yet in the new
lawns). It is very luxuriant
under tall bushes where the
mower does not reach. It forms
dense pure stands here.
December 5.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
Following heavy rain for 
over 24 hours. water has been


[7644-7645]
coming down all round the
trunks of trees instead of in 
flow lines only. About ¼ of
the coppice area is under
water, including some bonfire
sites.

1. Stool ash. Felled by axe. 9in.
1898[SYMBOL]1. Fast growth till 1920,
thereafter gradually slowing.
1910 very narrow.

2. Coppice oak from a stump
closely resembling the others
in the wood. 11 x 7½ in. (markedly
excentric). Much heart-wood.
1917[SYMBOL]1. 1936 narrow. 1951-5
wide. Not butt-rotted. A small
crooked tree.

3. Ash. 9in. 1900. uniform
except for 1911-15 (very narrow),
1926 (very wide), 1944-5 (narrow),
1959 - (narrow).

4. Stool maple. 9in. 61 years.

The pond is nearly up to 
the level of the surrounding
land on the N.W.
December 6.
The river is in spate, almost
up to the edge of the Anchor
quay. Part of Sheep's Green is 
under water.
December 1.
Cold-front weather with a 
hard frost
December 8.
Dry rot on the street side

[7646-7647]
of E staircase has consumed
several bonding courses on 
the outside wall of three
storeys, and has caused several
floor joists to be plated.
December 9.
The Leckhampton Primulas 
are developing leaf rosettes.
December 10.
Owls have not been much
heard recently in Leckhampton.
December 11.
The sedum from the
Lamfenjoch rapidly shrivels in 
a warm room.
December 12.
Polystictus versicolor.
Abundant on an old
pear butt with roots which
has been lying about for

some years out of doors at 
Coton anbd was now split up 
for firewood. Many sporophores
on downward-facing surfaces
and in this case sessile
at an excentric point on the 
back, or [!!!!]to[!!!!] stalked from the 
back. Occasionally there
[Diag]

[7648-7649]
is a perfectly central stalk
from the back. Dorsal stalks
are clothed like the back.
Colours fawn. P.5. pale pink.
very chatoyant.
This fungus is apparently
responsible for a softish pink
rot. Armillaria appeared
to be in some areas of the 
stump demarcated by zone
plates.
December 13.
A remarkable Chrysanthemum
was among a bouquet pre-
sented to Mrs Evans at a 
function. The others are 
a standard double commercial
variety with curling yellow
florets with small ragged scale
on the surfance. The largest

(about 4 in. diam) is completely
divided through the middle,
one half being similar to the
others in all respects, the
other half having pure white
smooth florets similar in 
shape. Some of the white
florets nearest the line of
junction have traces of 
yellow near the base. The 
junction line is straight
and diametric. There is
no visible difference in the 
bracts or the stem: the 
secondary heads have all 
been removed when young.
This specimen probably came
from a funereal set-piece
dismbembered for the occasion
and it would be diccicult to 


[7650-7651]
trace its origin.
December 14.
The chimerical chrysanthemum
was photographed and pressed.
December 15.
Akebia in Leckhampton
loses its leaflets.
December 16.
A soft damp brown rot
was found in an oaken
sill of the wall on the
N. side of Q staircase passage
in the Old Court during
renewal of the floor. The 
sill had been below the 
level of the former brick
floor. It is not clear whether
any studs were attached to
it.
December 17.

The rotten sill was removed
and replaced by brickwork
December 18.
The Cam is again very 
high.
Norton Wood, W. Suffolk,
is of oak standards with 
birch coppice. Undergrowth
less dense than is usual
in Cambs.
There is very considerable
flooding of  wet meadows
in Suffolk:
(i) Valley of Barnham Water
at Tostock.
(ii) Valley at Wetherden.
(iii) Gipping valley from
Haughley southwards. The
water is up to ¼ mile
wide, in places (as just




[7652-7653]
above the Fisons works at Bram-
ford) flowing and moving
continuously all across the
meadows. The river is 
rather clear, except where 
it suddenly contracts as 
at Bramford. It is not
embanked in any way.
December 19.  [Diag]
There is still
a large area of heath in 
Bixley, Foxhall. Purdis-farm,
and Nacton. It is mainly furze.
It extends into the municipal
boundary of Ipswich.
December 20. [Diag]
The river reached the 
top surface of the Anchor
quay but has since gone
down.

December 21.
The weather is now less
wet.
December 22.
Gulls are about in Norwich
December 23. [Diag]
Honesty seedlings are numerous.
December 24.
Both large sycamores in 
The front flowered abundantly
this year.
December 25
A definite coal-tit was
seen to come to a bag of 
pea-nuts on the trellis: the 
first [!!!!] seen in the garden.
December 26.
Collybia relutipes occurs on 
a poplar in Morse Avenue.
The trunk is still alive,

[7654-7655]
though moribund from repeated
lopping.
December 27.
A log cut from the [????]ew in
the front garden during
recent trimming was 2½ in
diam, 12 years old, with about
6 years of heart-wood.
December 28.
Following several days of 
hard frost, the ground was 
frozen to 1½ in. deep (bare
ground in several places in
the garden).
December 29.
Roses are flowering at
G[????]leston despite the frost.
The Lothingland sea-cliffs
consist of sandy gravels and 
sands overlying clay. The spring

line (clearly visible today because
of an accumulation of massive
ice) is some 6ft from the surface
near Corton church, but sinks
northwards and disappears
under the beach against G[????]leston
golf links. The rate of erosion
appears to be greatest
where the springs are lowest.
Run-off from fields has
led to some wash-outs.
The small sycamore
wood on the cliff top opposite
Hopton has been badly 
damaged following the fellling 
of a strip about 6 yards
wide along the cliff. Much
of the rest of the wood has 
died.
Smymium is vigoroulsy mak-


[7656-7657]
ing new growth. One plant
was found flowering. The old
f[????]s have a strong characteristic
carraway-like flavour.
December 30.
A rook alighted in the big oak tree about 100 yards S.
of the E.end of the garden.
Collybia [????]elutipes is turgid
after the frost.
December 31.
An hornbeam tree was seen
in a hedge at Uggeshall.
Holly trees are common in 
Blything.


January 1.
The river is again [Diag]
high after heavy rain.
January 2.
Cnsiderable changes were 
made among the pot plants
thus:
[!!!!] Repotted. 1. Aloe from 4 in.
to 6 in. Roots formed a 

[Diag]

loose cage around the sides

[7658-7659]

and bottom of the pot.  7 leaves photosynthetic, remains of 8 old ones.  There is one stolen about 2 in. long from the collar, anout to break through the surface.

2.  Gasteria ("Bishops"), from Mrs. Tuck.  From 4" to 6".  A mass of fibrous roots concentrated at the sides and bottom of the pot.  The main rosette has 12 active leaves in three twisted rows.  Around it are six stolons, of which one is about to break through, and the other five bear 5, 4, 4, 3, 3 aerial leaves.  The leaf arrangement does not develop until the fifth leaf (see sketch).

[DIAG] x2/3

3.  Sempervivum tirolienois xysyriaum
From 2 1/2" to 4".  One rosette, large (c. 1in).  Pot about 1/3 full of roots; the latter very fine

[7660-7661]

and fibrous as with all sempervivums.

4.  S. styriacum.  From 2 1/2" to 3".  Six rosettes, up to 1/2".  Pot about half full of roots.

Semperviva from Norwich.  
17.  Bishop-gate Street.  3" pot.  4 rosettes
18.  Mutterbergertal 1956.  3 1/2" pot.  3 rosettes

All the mosses were discarded as dead, except for one of the Dicranum rigosum from Calus, and the big pot from Aldrans.  Discarded 1962/18,/19,/20. 

The following weed seeds were sown in [!!!!] shallow seed-pots, in a mixture of sand and Leck-hampton soil (as was used for putting the succulents) and placed out on the balcony under a net.

500 Silene noctiflora  } Devil's Ditch
150 Specularia hybrida }
Cricieth 1962 trouser turnups

Filago spathulata      }

January 3.  Sempervivum collection.
1.  S. tirolensis.  (Patfchenkoft 1961).
Rosettes large.  Leaves open, flat, obovate (2-3 times as long as wide), with a stout purple muco, dark green, marginal cilia short, stout, colourless.  

[7664-7665]

Evidently, a microspecies of S. tectonum.
2.  No label.  Identical except for the slightly longer leaves, less pronounced colourless mucus, longer more flexous cilia.  S. tectorum.
3.  S. tlroliensis x styriacum (Patfcher-kofl 1961).
Rosette large middle-sized leaves, flat, slightly reflexed, oblong-tanceolate (3-4 times as long as wide), yellowish-green, mucro weak, concolorous, cilia short, straight, colourless
4.  S. styriaaum (ibid.)  Rosettes middle-sized.  Leaves erect, lanceolate (5-6 times as long as wide), acute, grass-green, shortly pubescent on both sides, cilia short, white.
5.  Egnefengrat 1964.  Rosettes small.  Leaves flat, obovate (2-3 times as long as wide), wollen, yellowish-green, subacute, with short coloursless stalked glands on both sides, cilia undifferentiated.  D. montanum.
6.  Probably Hoher Lehner 1961.  Rosettes small. Leaves comex, flat, oblong-lanceolate (3-4 times as long as wide), very swollen, yellowish-green, acute, with short stalked glands on both sides, cilia distinctly longer.  S. Styriacum.
7.  Mutterbergertal 1956.  Rosettes small.  Leaves flat, obovate (2-3 times as long as wide), yellowish-green, acuminate, with short-stalked glands on both sides, marginal cilia 

[7666-7667]

undifferentiated, apical, slightly arachnoid.  S. arachnoideum.
8.  Bishop Gate Street c. 1950.  Leaves erect, obovate-triangulous, acute, marginal cilia highly arachnoid.  Rosettes small, flat-topped.  S. tomentosum.  
January 4.
A mouse was heard about 7 a.m. in my bedroom noisily munching a bar of chocolate in the corner of the room.  It disappeared among some papers in a bookcase.  It had probably been there before as certain papers and specimens had been shredded.
January 5.
The mouse was heard about 11 p.m. in a cupboard in my sitting room.  It was in the bottom of the cupboard, full of paper parcels of specimens.  It had shredded some of the paper to about 1/8 in.  wide strips, but not attacked the specimens.  There was a hole in the floor leading to the cupboard.
Jaunary 6.
The weather continues mild.
January 7.
The owls were heard in Leckhampton.
January 8.
The mouse has again been at papers in the bedroom.  This has a carpet going right up to the wall.

[7668-7669]

January 9.
Hayley Wood.
Coppicing and peramulation.
1.  Ash 4 1/2 in.  Cut in winter of 1920-21.  '21-'27, very wide; '27-31 narrow' '32-'40 wide' '41-'45 very narrow; '46-'53 wide' '54 -- medium.
2.  An oak by the ditch on the N. side of Hayley Lane South.  This had grown up in the ancient roadway (like several oaks still standing).  27 in. c. 120 years (all but the last laid down).  This stump and a few near it are much fresher in appearence than the First War stumps.  The site is about the best drained in the wood, because of the two ditches nearby.
3.  The oak felled in December.  A slice was taken from the stump as a permanent record.  Ring count is difficult to establish certainly because of false rings.  Pribably 1917 of 1918 is the first summer of growth.  Rings wide up to 1928 (1928 phenomenally wide), medium to 1935, then wide to 1940, narrow to 1946, medium [!!!!] to 1960, then medium-wide.  Heaart-wood to c. 1946, slight brown stain in very centre.

Rhytidiadelphus triquetnes

[7670-7671]

occurs in small [!!!!] quantity in a dense mat of Thuidium tamariscirum with minimum undulation and Pladiochila noplemoides.  The site is in the S. quarter, about 30 yards W. of the junction of the Pond ride and the ditch, close to a curious ash with a big ascending branch from low down, in a grove of small ashes with Deschampsia.

Rutting areas are frequent in the S. quarter.

A very small quantity of Ptuilidium pulchemimum 2 was found amoung abdundant maoses of Lepidozia reptans 3 on an old oak stump in the N. part of the 1966 plot (designated as Prohibted Area 3).

The badger hole under the ash tree in Hayley Lane earthworks is still open, though no definite signs of occupation were found.

The water level in the coppocie area is down slightly.

January 10.  Several of the sempervivum have been ribbled, probably buy the mouse.

January 11.  The mouse was heard again at 4 a.m. rustling among papers and specimens in the bedroom.  When the stacks were taken down, it sprang away and disappeared under

[7672-7673]

the carpet.  Investigation showed some small holes in the floor, disused pipe-chases.

January 12.  The holes in the floor were all sealed with Polyfilla cement and gravel.

January 13.  Owls were heard in Leckhampton.

January 14.  A hard frost.  The swimming pool was seen (at about 11 p.m.) to be covered with a very thin discontinuous film of ice, which was in the form of giant crystals up to 9 in. diam. with hexagonal symmetry, six ridges radiating from a small central disk.

January 15.  Snow fell to produce a layer of about 1 1/2 in. thick.

January 16.  Cherry Hint on Roman Road, Wandlebury.
The depth of snow outside Cambridge is about 2 in.
Some beeches in the first belt along the Romand Road have been felled to provide passage for a power wire.  They are stunted andnot more than 30ft high.
1.  s ft diam. 1850 +/- 10.  Fast to 1900; medium 1901-2; very slow 1903-5; medium 1906-23; 1924 very slow; 1925

[7674-7675]

with two false rings; 1926-31 medium; 1931-3 fast; 1934 medium; 1935-6 very slow; 1937-9 medium; 1940 fasts; 1941 - medium.
2.  1'8" diam.  1855 +/-10.  Slow to 1882; 1883-1899 fast; 1900-3 very fast; 1904-8 medium; 1909-10 slow; 1926-30 slow; 1931-32 medium; 1933-4 very slow; 1935-6 medium; 1937-44 slow; 1945-9 slow; 1950 onwards medium.

1.  Amicula ausicula-judge
2.  Daldimia concentrica.  Both abundant on one of the beeches brunt neart the cout-hut.  The former occurs on the dead areas from which the bark has fallen away; the latter along the edges of the dead areas.  There was a slight further fall of snow.

January 17. Hard frost all day.
January 18.  There was some skating on Queen's [!!!!] Ditch.  The Leckhampton pool is frozen, but will not yet bear one's weight.
January 19.  Queens' Ditch was walked on.
Robins still come to my sitting-room window and take food put out for them.

[7676-7677]

January 20.  Snow fell for much of the day, brining the total depth in Leckhampton to about 2 1'2 in.  There was then a slow thaw.

January 21.  The thaw continues slowly.

January 22.  There is still a complete snow cover in Leckhampton.  The ice on the pool was broken, and found to be 2 1/2 in. thick, including regelated snow.

January 23.  Hayley Wood coppicing and perumbulation.
With H.J. Birks and H. Lees.  The ground is covered with about 2 in. of snow, rendering bryophytes difficult to find unless on logs (and sometimes even then, as big logs also hold snow).
Two more prohibited areas were stacked out, enclosing abundant Lepidozia replains.  The Ptilidium site is in one.  The pond was overed with ice and frozen snow 2 1/2 in. thick, Cullit-riche being frozen into the ice.  Somebody had been walking on it, but it was dangerous.

X. Atricum undulatum.  Occasional in N. quarter.
B. Dicranoqeisia cirrata.  Very

[7678-7679]

abundant on an enormous ash stool (some left diam. at base) about 150 yards S.W. of the pond.
Deer tracks are very frequent in the pond area and especially in the S. quarter, where they show the animals to have been following one another in a herd.  They are scattered and usually solitary elsewhere in the wood.  No obvious sign of different sizes of slot.  Two snares were seen; pne in a rather open part of the wood near the far end of the W. secondary ride, attached to a tree but not near any deer track nor near anything, which might cause deer to pass by it; the other in the place, near the S.W. end of Hayley Ditch, where two were found previously.

1.  Tremella foliacea.  Frequent on hazel and Crataegous oxyacanthoides.  Up to 3 in. across; up to 15ft from ground.
2.  Dacryomy ces debiquescens.  Frequent on hazel.
3.  Lycoperdon pyriforme.  On base of ash, about 150 yards N. of the grove.

Some curious tracks were seen in the snow along

[7680-7681]

the popular rise in the N. quarter.  They were elliptical in a long zigzag:

[DIAG] 2 1/2" 4" 1'1" 2'11"

The shape of each track could not be made out as the snow had partly melted.  No impression of deer or other sharp hooves could, however, be seen underneath in the litter.

1.  Popular 6 in. 1924 +/-1.  Fast to 1940.  1941-48 very slow.  Thereafter medium.
2.  Ash 6 1/2 in. in 1922.  Fast till 1935; 1936-58 slow; 1959 - slow.
3.  Ash, same stool as 2.  7in. 1925.  Fast till 1936; moderate 1937-59; slow 1960-37 "ft" high.
4.  One of the four poles from a biggish stool ash (poles marked with white crosses).  44 "ft" high.  Crown weak.  Trunk pumped by brown rot and with amny goat-moth holes.  1898 (year of first ring).  Fast 1909; very slow 1910-12; fast 1913-19; slow 1920-22; medium 1923-37; slow 1938-45; medium 1946-53; very slow 1954--

[7682-7683]

A badger's footmark distinct though partly obliterated was een by the S.W. ride.  [DIAG]  A squirrel's dray was seen in a hole in an ash.  Fox footmarks were seen near the glade.

r.  Homalia trichomanoides.  Abundant on a big ash stool [!!!!] by a big fallen trunk S.E. of the glade.  [DIAG] View of site from S.W.

S. Nowellia currifolia.  Abundant but difficult to find because of snow.  The water level is difficult to see but apparently the same as last time.

E. Aulacomnium androggrium.  on rotten log on the N.E. ride opposite the 1965 plot (HJ Birks).

January 24.  The snow largely disappeared during the day.
January 25.  The last traces of snow vanished.
January 26.  A warm wet day.

[7684-7685]

January 27.  Thick ice persists on Queens' Ditch.
January 28.  Heleeborus is flowering in Leckhampton.
Jan. 29.  Hayeley.

V. Poilidium pulchemimum.  Two patches only are known, both on fallen oak tops, each about 3 in. diam.
S. Acrocladium cuspidatum.  Occurs in the small pond at the end of the 2nd N. ride.

1.  Merulius sp.  On the lower trunk of a mighty dead ash by the 2nd N. ride.
2.  Stereum hirsutum.  Among other places, extrememly luxuriant on the upper trunk and limbs of the said ash.
3.  Armillaria mellea.  Rhizomorphis on a fallen crooked oak which arches over E. of the pool.  They extend at least 20ft from the bast; halfway ip, where the bark has partly fallen off, a certain of Huizmorphs about 6ft long hangs out.  [SYMBOL] Also on a dead hawthorn bush in the 1966 plot.

(1) Poplar.  36 "ft".  8 1/2 in.  1930.  Very uniform.  Perhaps perviously cut.
