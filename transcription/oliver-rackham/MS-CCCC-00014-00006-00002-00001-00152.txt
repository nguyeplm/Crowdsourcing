9-18 in. light brown with yellish patches, similar composition of sand, clay, stones.

New rules.  soil layers remained.

8-18 in. Subsoil with a little topsoil.

18 in.-3ft. Reddish gravel with a little yellowish gravel owing to convolutions.  3ft-7ft Mainly yellowish buft gravel.

[DIAGRAM] Dark brown clayey sound with some gravel

[11472-11473]

1.  Normal topsoil, dark brown clayey sound with some gravel 0-10in.
2.  Normal subsoil, similar but mid brown and with mixed gravel.  10"-18"
3.  Reddish brown sand with gravel, little clay.  Ends c. 18"-3ft.
4.  Gravel with particles of chalk mark and a little sand, no clay.  Buff In pockets just below 3. 
5.  Humified streaks going down to 3.9"ft thro' other stratz
6. Concretion of gravel, sand, lo calcereous matter.  Like soft concrete.  Nahovel?
7.  Yellow sand with little gravel.  Occasional potatoes.
8.  Bright golden yellow gravel, mainly small, with sand, Pcokets and ? layer at 4 3".
9.  Thin pocket of chalk mark, c. 2 in. thick, at 5 ft.
10.  Buff sand with gravel of mixed size.  General matrix, also below 9.

Each lysimeter was dismantled and removed and the teak box extracted by digging oak or more trenches alongside and lifting it out by means of the chains left under it.  The two profiles are of the sides of the extraction trenches.

Both boxes were perfectly sound when pulled out.  Abundant growth of myxomycete on the outside of the older one.  This grew loosely over the tarred outside of the wooden box.  Several plants, the largest semicircular and over 3ft dia. whole plant white 

[DIAGRAM] [SYMBOL]23

trees of thin woolly filaments closely appriessed usually in radial zones, connected by a network of mycehial strands.  The latter run over the whole area occupied by the thallus, but are free of the substratum and only occassionally attached to the mycelial areas.

1.  Normal topsoil.  Dark gray-brown sand with much clay and frequent mush clay and frequent stones to 1m. dia. 0-10.

2.  Normal subsoil.  Medium brown, simiar texture and composition 10-1'6

3.  Bright reddish-brown sand without clay, many stones up to 1 1/2 in. (especially at 1'6-2'0 where they form a definite pavement).  Black channels frequent.  Many lighter yellowish patches especially below.

4.  Buff sandy gravel without clay. Proportions of sand and gravel very varied.  Flames and mushrooms contain more gravel.  Occasional bands of gravel sometimes forming concreted ledges.  Also strata of sand sometimes very firm and concreted.  Occasional channels.

Channels usually 1-3 in. dia, running almost vertically thro' 3 and penetrating 4.  Contents dark gray to black, somewhat variable, including stones.

[11486-11487]

Roots are abundant in 1 and 2 and frequent throughout 3, reaching the lowest parts.  Rarely 4 and not more than 6 inside it.  Channels always contain roots.

The mushrooms and flames are not bounded by dark plates as they were in the old pits.

Stones tend to be verticed in mush and flames.

Both boxes were safely installed and levelled in their holes.

Novemeber 23.
Sedum telephinum: old shoots have become sudden and rooted off, apparently without further frost.  One old stem is relatively sound and still flowering.

Long stretches of 2nd and 3rd N. Riders are under water.  By 3rd N. Ride is an oak struck by lightning many years ago which continues to live by a single branch some 15ft up forming a new leader.  The searnius right to the ground where it originally extended over halfway round and rushed about 1/3 of the roots.  This has healed for several iches on either side.

The bone moldening wood is criss-crossed with 

[11498-11499]

squirrel claw-marks which are shallow scratches at between 30 degrees and 50 degrees to the horizontal

[DIAGRAM]

Scratches up to 2in. long.  Growth of Protococcus suggests that the dvey they lead to has been in use for some time and is still used.

3 rabbits were seen in the N. Section.  One near the pond.

A deer was seen to cross 1st N. Ride during the copping operations (axes, chain-saw, &c.) only a block's wideth away.  It moved towards the usppicing in a leisurely manner with head down.  No antlers.

A considerable flow of water from the S.W. corner.

Many small branches have been broken in the crowns of the lakes in the summer, probably by the September gale.

Heracleusm and Anthriscus are flowering frequently in the roadside verges around Bourne & Long

[11500-11501]

stowe mown in the summer.

By the S.W. main ride is an ivy plant some 12ft high up a hazed.  It has assumed the tree habit and overwhelmed the hazel.  Its trunk is some 1 1/2 in dia.  Only one hazel stem is involved.  The ground system, consists of a single branch with ground-type leaves growing up the same hazel trunks.  There are no creeping shoots.  A few oxlip plants still have some green leaves.
