The Triangle.  Furrows beginning to fill with water.
The ridges bear a characterisitic polygon pattern.  Polygons about 1ft across, markedly domed.  In the hollows between are deep cracks into which twigs & debris fall.  Soil in the hollows is markedly granular; that on the polygons is compact.  Most of the polygons bear Deschampsia tufts, usually [??] or dead, evidently dating from a period of more open vegetation.

Bourn Wood.
The part belonging to Mr. Bevan has now been reduced by clearing to the "original" word.  Outline as on the 18.4.68 map, except for a slight convex bend on the E. side.

The eastern wood can hardly be primary as at least part is on R. & F.  It may have been an oak wood at one time but is now almost completely occupied by elm, like the W. wood.

Lime coppice suggests planting.  Moderate size of ash stools suggests a fairly late date, possibly early 18th cent.  Note that the ground flora (mercury in particular), as far as can be ascertained at this time, suggests long establishment.
Sycamore a fairely recent invasion.
Boundary as on 28.4.68 map, except that the S.W. boundary has a slight bend near its S.E. end.

The field S.E. of the wood contains one block of R. & F. apparently conforming to the field

Huge bush of Viburum Lautanes: c. 12ft high, 30-40 stems to c.2" dia., stool about 15in. [??] like a hazel.  Produces new shoots like v. fragrams but the old ones stay alive tho' not vigorous.  In the S. boundary of the eatern block of the wood, grid ref. 317557 boundaries.  It ends in what appears to be an old hedgebank.

Swansley Wood.
All disappeared, including the boundary, except for a small area of secondary elm, opposite the Elsworth [!!] entrance.

Elm cuttings were secured for propagation.
Immediately W. of the wood is a strip of land bordering the road on the S. towards the Gibbet.  Much of the elm timber has been removed from this in the last few years.  Scrub and rough grassland are left.

Hayley Wood (Bob Pemia: surveying for possible sites for pond-forming dams).  The S. wood-bank has three old passes or gaps for overflow besides the one at the S.W. corner which now functions.

[11520-11521]

Site A: a rather large shallow marshy area would result.  
Site B: a dam here, although short, would be relatively unproductive because the fall of the ground is too great.
Site C: a dam would have to be about 30 yards long, but would indicate about 1/2 acre; this would be very good if combined with judicious felling.
Site D: the most immediately promising.  The wood-bank and Hayley Ditch would be joined by a short dam.  An old [??] would have to be blocked.  A large deep pond would result.

The South Section Trangle does not contain any promising sites.  The East Section is possible but unpromising.

The whole wood is very wet, with pools in the Marsh Swamp up to c.30 yards dia. The furrows in the Triangle are filling.

December 25.  Prop Primula

December 26.  About 2 in. of snow fell in showers in cold-front weather, persisting on the ground and on trees despite a slight thaw.

December 27.  Further periods of snow, heavy at times and driven by a strong N.W. wind lying on vertical faces of trees and buildings including the cathedral spire.  On the back grass there were 3 1/4 in. deep in the afternoon despite air temperature at least in degrees above freezing and periods of bright sunshine.  About 2 in. more fell later in the day.

Collybia velutipes occurs on many of the pillard willow trees in Morse Avenue.

Much snow was encountered on the way to Cambridge on the evening, at least 6 in. deep between Wymondham and Thetford and covering the track over land.  More was falling.

No snow lying between Ely and Cambridge.

Cambridge has a very thin powdering of snow.  A very

[11524-11525]

intense frost and drying wind.

December 28.  About 2 1/2 in. of snow fell at Cambridge in the night.  
Only a slight powdering between Huntingdon and Ioncaster.  Depth then gradually increased to about 6 in. near Bishop Auckland.
From Borobridge onwards on the AI snow fell in showers, with a strong N.W. wind driving it and bringing clouds of ice crystals off the fields.  The road became difficult to see and its edges indistinct.  
Visibility a few yards at times, especially on the motorway between Catterick and Aycliffe.
The A689 between Rushyford (Chitton) and Counden (Bishop Auckland) was similar.
The road between Westerton (Bishop Auckland) and Todhills (Byers Green) is a ridgeway rising to 500ft.  Drifts with a minimum depth of c. 18 in. only just motorable through.  Snow cornices in fantastic shapes up to 3 ft deep by the hedges.
Mild frost or possible thaw at Trodhills.

[11526-11527]

December 29.  CLARENCE HOUSE TODHILLS BYERS GREEN DURHAM
Snow fell most of the day out there was a slow thaw.
The Warrens' garden contains a fine qych-elm and a hawthorn tree some 40ft high.
The house (like many in the district) is built of a soft tawny sandstone with brown and greenish streaks which erodes easily.
Trees in the area show slight soot blackening though there is no great concentration of houses or heavy industry.  No lichen.

December 30.  Many coal tips in the Brandon & Spenny moon areas have been planted with COrsican and ash of some 20 years' growth.

Durham Cathedral and many houses in the town are of a similar sandstone, usually as rough blocks, sometimes ashler or rag.

The countryside appears to be of relatively late inclusive with stright-hedges and few stone walls.  Flank altered by mining.
Root frame of Clarence House (c.1840)
Span c. 30ft.  Low pitch (slated).  Narrow ridge pole.

[11528-11529]

[DIAG] King-post & braces.  2 purlins.  Radius shallower than principal rafters so that backs of the latter are in the same plane as the common rafters.  Common rafters very slight (c. 2x2 in)
The purlins are housed in the principal rafters by a very shallow tension prevented from droppping out by a small through tenon pegged on the other side.  The two purlins on either side of the trees are pegged side by side and so are not in the same line.

This is rather unsatisfactory and in one case the peg has allowed enough play for the tenon to drop out.  The long tenon or tounge has split off and the joint has failed.

December 30.  Much of the snow melted yesterday, but it still covers the fields.  The thickness of ice on flooded gravel pits and marshes in the valley floor just permits skating.  There is no ice on the river.  

Many sheep are out in fields.

Soil (as revealed in a quarry by the old railway cutting) is rather thin and apparently autogenous, boulder clay (if it occurs, as suggested by cobblestones in the streets of Durham and a large erratic at Todhills) is only on the ridges.

The rocks are alternatively sandstones, shales, and clays, presumably Metozoic.
By the roadside, 208343, are a few acres of hawthorn scrub with few other woody plnats.  Small patches of broom tgorse.  Below Wilington is a small patch of ash scrub with an understorey of broom & gorse.  

[11532-11533]

Sycamores are the commonest planted trees in the district but soon decay and are short-lived.  Populous carescens is occasional as big trees at Willington.
Holly occurs in a hedge at Todhills.

December 31.  Ridge & Furrow.
1.  On flood plain at Bishop Auckland, 208343.  Narrow straight ridges, probably a water-meadow system.
2.  Usual straight ridges, normal width, in a paddock behind a farm at todhills, 212340.
3.  Generally frequent along the railway from Aycliffe, co. Durham, to E. Retford.  Particularly abundant around Darlington and N. of Doncaster, less frequent in the Selby area.  Usually straight but sometimes curved.  Reversed-S seen at 6ft Aycliffe and (partly preserved) N. of York.  On slopes and flat land; nearly always up & down on slopes.
4.  A system of probable water meadow channels by the Selby Canal, Brayton.

Between Baburn and Riccall, S. of York, are some woods by the railway: one E. of Bell Hall, one E. of Moreby Hall, and one (not on 1/3m. map) E. of the railway.

[11534-11535]

They appear to cotain the following types:
1.  Sycamore pure large coppice.
2.  Ash large coppice or once-[??]:
Standards and small coppice not known (thinned and planted with conifers)
3.  Ash and oak standards wit hash maidens and very overgrown ash berge coppice or once cuts.  E. of railway.

Snow had fallen everywhere along the route -- least in the Orantham-Peterboro' area.  Probably never more than 6in. anywhere.  Considerable drifts and cornices in few dykes near Whittesea.

There have been severe frosts especially where snow cover is slight.  Icicles up to 2ft long in the cornbrush cuttings.  Selby Canal frozen over.

The Ouse Washes were completely filled: no bushes projecting [??] along the railway embarkment: lightly frozen near.  W. end of the Nere Washes frozen.

No more snow appears to have fallen at Cambridge.  Hard frost everywhere.  The Leckchampton pool is covered with about 3.4 in. thick of ice.  the main river quite clear.

[11536]

Death-watch beetle has been active until recently in the oak jousts over the old entrance to the Old Court.
Much of the sapwood is consumed, also knots, but little of the heart.  A few live insects have been found.  The oak floor boards are only occasionally penetrated.  Most severe on the underside of the jousts: the ends in the walls on either side are little affected.  Very few holes in the waken lenths of an earlier ceiling preserved in the walls.  These jousts were sealed in below by a ceiling & above by tongued and grooved boards.
