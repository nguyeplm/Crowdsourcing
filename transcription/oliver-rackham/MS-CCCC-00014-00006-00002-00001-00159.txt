HOTEL PLAYA CAMP DE MAR ANDRAITX MALLORIA

Stone walls.  Some around Camp de Mar nearly built show an unusual degree of perfection in the art.  Stones rough-hewn to polygonal shape with such precision that a knife cannot be inserted.  In hard limestone ([SYMBOL] 23) or calcareous sandstone ([SYMBOL] 24).  Some older walls of this type exist, e.g. a terrace wall at Campde Mar farm ([SYMBOL] 29).

Weather.  During the visit there was great variety.  Seldom warm.  Rain in Mar. 26, 27, and 29 for short periods.

[12002-12003]

An early-morning froast was reported on the beach one day.  No deiduous trees show any signs of leaves.  Sea always calm.  No opportunity of observing it at night.

Inula viscosa.  Abundant along roadsides, but less common than S. France.  Not an arable weed.

Erica Multiflora.  A plant of sattered and somewhat inexpicable distribution.  Around Camp de Mar it is associated with clays and marb, sometimes (though not always) on old cultivation terraces.  In several places (as on the road to P. d'Andraitx) it appears to require extra moisture.

This hypothesis of a somewhat mesophytic drought-sensitive plant agrees with its distribution in deep soil on hard limestone on Gourrafa (p.1866-7, 1853).  But it also occurs as a diff plant on Gourrafa (p.1851).  Similar occurences in the better soils at higher altitudes in the Cordillera (p.1818).

Its absence on Galatzo is curious: only seen at c.300m under pines.

Some of these peculiarities can be accounted for by supposing that it is more exacting in the extremely dry climate of low altitudes in the W. corner of the 

[12004-12005]

island.

Plantago psyllium and cyrops.  Roadside rather than amble weeds.  They occaisonally form a dense turf on land that has been a year since ploughing , as near the road junction above camp de Mar.

Lavandula serrata.  Apparently confined to the W. tip of the island, which is curious because it occurs in abundance on a variety of slopes and exposures (including Garrafa).  Always on hard limestone.  See p.1747.

Asphodelus microcropus.  One of the most widespread plants in the island.  Almost universal.  Sea level to c. 850 m. in Galazo and 1000 m. on Puig Mayor.  All soils including pockets in hard limestone.  Many plant communities.  The commonest plant of roadsides and the most resistant plant to the grazing of swine.  Very tolerant of shade.  See p. 1746.

Rhamnus oleoides.
A dwarf intricate spiny shrub looking very like a small form of Prunus spinosa.  Abundant on Formentor; here it usually grows by itself as a Spalierftrauch against the rocks.

[12006-12007]

On Galatzo it mixes with the other Igelheide bushes to from mixed thickets.

Holoschoenus.  Rare; almost only at Camp de Mar, where it occurs [????] in the beds of watercourses.

Arundo donax.  In addition to the occurence in the Esenada de les Hortigaad valley, there is a small be din the wady by the hotel.

Near Palma airfield there are numerous pumping windmills of the usual type.

March 28 [cont. p.1912]
Andraitx.  A town laid out on a grid pattern.  Big barn-like church with ting external windows and no architectural features.  Houses mainly 2-storeyed, on the street, garden (if any) out the side or back.  Architecture very like S. France; the town looks very like Le Touvet (although more prosperous).

fromaga = cheese.

North of the town is a dry valley with mixed agriculture loeading up to Coll de sa Gremola.  This pass, though low, is rugged, with a tunnel.  

[12008-12009]

The contour road to Estallenchs is very fine.  Steep slopes and cliffs down to the sea.  Another tunnel.

Weather.  Very mixed.  Generally cold but bright.  Strong winds on summit.  The rest of the party at Barnelloufar got soaked by a thunderstorm.  Dark clouds seen around.  Snow was seen in sheltered places, in E. facing chimmneys on Galatzo, 950 m.

Status of plant communities.  Oak woods.
Amost certainly primary.  Absence of cultivation remains; unusally large number (for Majorca) of woody species; definite woodland herbs.

Present condition uncertain.  The existence of apparently recent kiln sites has to be reconciled with the apparent variety of coppice stools, although none of the trees is >100 years.  Pssibly the charcoal sites are older than they look; a logging c.80 years ago for charcoal resulted in a large proportion of seed regeneration.  (Arbutus probably is coppiced).  Failure of oak to coppice might be attributed to climate, soil or time of year.  Feeling old enough

[12010-12011]

for most stumps to have rotted (a few visible, but this is probably due to more recent and more local cutting).

Pine woods.  These form a plausible attitudinal zone (especially on the plateau) which might be the natural home of pine.  There appears not to be a characteristic ground vegetation.  The history of the boundary between oak and piine 2 obscure.  There are a few stunted oaks in the pine belt, which suggests that oak may have gone higher at one time.

Summit vegetation.  Closely comparable to Formentor.  It is again probable that the severe climate keeps out trees.  Note the numerous woodland species, especially in deeo or shallow grykes, especially characteristics of this zone: Hellebrous, Clematis cirhosea, Buxus baleanica, &c.  Because of the isolation of the mountain and the presence of the restrited Igelheide species, it is unlikely that there ever was an acutal wood.  Woodland species were not so prominent at forementor.  Garrigue species (Pistacia, 

[12012-12013]

Asphodeluos, Urginea, &c.) also appear above the oak and in some cases much higher, which argues in relatively frost-free climate.  Wind pruning of such vegetation as there is is not severe.  Ampelodesmus (as elsewhere) is quite enigmatic.  Pastinaca lucida may be a woodland element (of Ping Mayor).

April 3.  Madingley Wood.  Surveying for map.

Belt 1a.  This (with the north margin) is clearly the oldest of the belts.  I thas a massive sinuous marginal wood-bank.  On the N. side the wood edge is a lynchet rather than a bank, because of the slope.

Belt 1b.  Although documentarily 18th cent.  This appeares to be more recent than 1a; apparently straight, slighter wood-bank, ditched off from 1a.

[12016-12017]

Belt 1c.  Effectively not separated from fields 4 and 5.  No ditches.  The R&F in 4 and 5 are parallel but this belt appears to have none; either it was flattened when the belt was planted, or the R&F is later.

Field 2.  Definitely a first-generation planting.  Trees in rows (too accurate to be determined by the R&F).  R&F spacing paced out (see map).

Field 3.  R&F carefully looked for but not found.  Trees not in rows; there are clearly 2 generations of which the larches and some are older.  The part of the field in the cemetery has been cleared of bushes and the N. earthworks destroyed.

Field 4.  R&F spacing paced out. Evidence of a narrow double dank (driftway?  margina belt?) cutting off the S.E. corner and running into the American cemetery.  Big ashes not accurately in rows; not accurately in rows; the contrary impression from the air is due to the trees

Field 5.  R&F spacing paced out.

Field 8.  Not ditched.  Note tha mercury is abundant in the northern 2/3 -- as it is in all the other secondary woodland.

9 April.  Madingley Wood (extra-mural course in local history).  The S. ride near the gate is blocked with several tall fallen Prunnus spinosa trees.  Party of about 20 taken round most of he historically different areas.

12 April.  A blue [????] was seen to go in and out of a nest in the hollow top of the lamp standard ouside my window, as last year.

15 April.  Little Whelnetham Spinney and Link Wood.
Apparently parts of Rushbrooke Park, planted up with conifers.

[12028-12029]

Chensil Grove, Bradfields.
A coppice wood with very sparse standards, apparently 2-layered.  Signs of boundary bank.  Probably ancient.  Fairly recently cut.  In maypole Green and elsewhere in Bradfield St. George, there are several very large pollard oaks set well back from the road, possibly making the limits of an old wide road.

Felsham Hall Wood and Monks' Park Wood (general survey, with David Dymond).

To be done.
1.  Map ground vegetation
2.  Map alders, willows, &c.
3.  Map elm and determine species
4.  Investigate effect of coppicing on ground vegetation
5.  Study management of heathland
6.  Transition between boulder clay and heath woodland
7.  Map enclosures in N.W. part of Monks' Park.
8.  Precise distribution of primroses and hybrids
9.  Record coppice methods and performance

There is not much flipendula in either wood.

Gooseberry -- near N. top Ox pend
Coppicing this uear around 2. only.  Less than an acrea has been cut.  Cut with the axe.  growth still vigorous in last rings.  The wood o nthe white is nearly as wet as Hayley.  Little standing water.  The bracken areas are somewhat drier.  Rides very wet.  Recently-coppiced areas do not show any great increase of ground vegetation; probably the young coppice closes in too early.
