Most of the wood appeares to have been coppiced within the last 10 years, but only small areas within 2 years; around 2. and 3. and around 10. between the ride and the ditch.  Growth of new coppice is very dense and almost impenetrable.

The boundary bank is about 3ft high and rather acute.  Runs round the whole perimeter.  The banks separating the N.W. handle from the remaining wood are very shallow.  The outer bank has a corner mound at the S.E. corner.  From here the Felsham-Gedding boundary takes off.  It consists of a substantial bank interrupted by a pond.  By the pond are two monumental park-like oaks some 4ft dia., and a row of four sickly beeches to c. 2ft dia.

"Fish Pond".
A flat-bottomed trenh some 6ft deep and 30ft wide with a stream flowing through the bottom.  At the lower end there is an old dam with overflow, cut through by a channel to drain the pond.  It tapers to an end where the stream enteres at the N.W. Mysteriously there is only the slightest up-cast, to the E.

Maulkin's Plantation.  Mainly birch, hazel, small ash coppice.  Standards: a few oaks to 9 in. dia.  Not very different from word immediately to the W. Primulas rare, entirely oxlip.

No very recent coppicing in Monks' Park; latest on both sides of N.E. ride, where it has closed in after c.5 years

Root's.
Coppicing is established in the main enclosure.

There are two ordinary large standard apple trees, both fallen to the N.
The area with primoses to hybrids to the W. could be part of the same system.
To the N.W. of Root's is a large very open area of bracken heath with birch x big nettle patches -- building site?

Felsham Hall Wood.
1.  Active coppice management
2.  Remarkably vigorous coppice growth
3.  Some birch cut as small (occasioanlly large) coppice.
4.  Very few standards (about 10 to the acre in much of the wood).  Standards small, with clean trunks.  Few stumps of similar size, felled mostly many years ago.  Density of stndardscannot have decreased much.
5.  Large and small coppice out together, apparently quite irregularly.
6.  Abundance of alder as a standard.
7.  Abundant Allium wisirum, locally dominant.
8.  Remarkably scarce hawthorn, mainly monogyna (no undoubted oxyacauthoides seen).
9.  Area of large-coppice elm.
10. Large bracken areas, abuting mainly on mercury.
11. Remarkably scarce blueberry abundant in the N.W. corner, not seen anywhere else.
12.  Clematis present
13.  Phosphatic plants rare.
14.  Holly occurs (no tree more than 3ft high seen) as small possibly suppressed saplings.
15.  Much Carex pendula but no C. dcutiformis.
16.  Several boundary pollands, those

on the S. quite small.
17.  Complex outline free from internal earthworks.
18.  Interseting earthworks at S.E. and S.W. corners

Monks' Park Wood.  
1.  Very recent coppice management
2.  Very vigorous coppice growth
3.  Transitious to birch wood (which predominates S. of the main ride).
4.  Very few standards (about 10 to the acre in recently coppiced areas).
5.  Large and small coppice cut together.  Ash overtops hazel when left for some decades, as in the N.E. section.
6.  Alder frequent.
7.  Hawthorn remarkably scarce and probably all monogyna.  (? does not play any part in the coppice system.)
8.  Some large-coppice elm.
9.  A few large-coppice oak stools, probab;y out at least twice.  Near 22.  small stools c. 1 1/2ft x 1 1/2 ft, markedly mushroom-shaped.
10. Excellent transition to heathland.  Best healthland around 23.  Deep bracken.  Trees very sparse, mainly oak & birch (margina; to rides).  No

[12054-12055]

coppice in such area, which are quite open away from the rides.  Soil (exposed in reclamation to S.E.) reddish brown sand, almost pure in places, with medium-sized gravel.  Heathland apparently goes over to Zone 2 as well as Zone 6.
11. Birch sometimes coppiced
12.  No bluebell
13.  Phosphatic plants rare except around Root's.
14.  Holly occurs
15.  Primroses and hybrids rare, only in certain parts of the Root's -- Maulkin's complex, where locally abundant
16.  Simple outline with several internal erthworks and old cleanings
17.  Much sallow in coppice [cont. p.2061]

Monks' Park Wood cont

Maulkins'.  Copppice well established, though no large stools.  The boundary bank certainly does take a curious bend at the S.W. corner.  Upcast inside.

The boundary of Monks' Park is consistently different from that of Felsham Hall.  Bank much wider and more shallow.  For a short stretch S. of the "fish pond" they can be compared side by side.

[12062-12063]

18.  One cherry tree

The area to the W. of the cottage site appears to be permanently rather open with grassland and heath.  This is not a result of recent clearing.  This is the main primrose-hybrid area.  There is one large beech nearby.

April 19.  Hayley Wood (Dr Bergkund, of S. Sweden, and Jim Dickson).
Pinford well lane, Joft, is a deeply sunk lane with several old pollard elms.  A stream runs along its gravelling bottom.  Dr. Berglund was very interested in the prevalence of pollarding, a historic practice which has almost disappeared in Sweden.  Coppicing is a historic practice which has quite disappeared there and left few traces.

The valley-bottom heddge to the W. of Knapwell Wood contains mercury.  There is much in the banks of the oldwood-close around the farmyard immediately W. of the wood.

The small ride from the end of Main Ride to the end of S.E. ride was cut.  A few small elms were cut.  One of these had a wet heart with sour smell: pronounced by J.Rishbeth to be wet-wood.  Others were similar.  No obvious trunk symptoms or slime fluxes.

[12068-12069]

April 26.  At Boot's Bridge, Wimblington, is a pit overgrown with trees whic his being considered as a reserve.  The road from Manea to Purl's Bridfge follows the old crooked course of a branch of Darcey Lode, a natural water course represented by a shallow ditch.  It reappeares on the Washes and at Oxlade beyong.

The Washes are now largely dry.  Numerous herons.

Bassenhally Pit is a very large and old pit said to be used to provide material for the banks of Moreton's Leam. surrounded by high banks.

It consists of areas of grassland and deep water with [????] running out into it.  Reed-fields in shallower water.  Wooded areas, mainly hawthorn.  On the northern edge of Whittesey island.

(Naturalists' Trust excursion: Sbetham -- Sutton -- March (meeting -- Wimblington -- Welches Dam -- Whimblington -- Benwick -- 40 Feet Bridge -- Ponder's Bridge -- Whittlesey -- Bassenhally Pit -- Eastrea -- Hobb's Bridge -- March -- Cambridge.)

[12070-12071]

April 26.  cont.
Sutton has several old pollard elms.

In the middle of [????] is old grassland with earthworks.  There are several very large elm pollards.  The church is mainly Victorian but many contain some medieval fragments.

Doddington Wood.  The site is arable.  No hedges survive.  There are two possible boundary pollards on the N. side.

Norwood Road.  Apparently entirely on peat.  Mainly dark hawthorn scrub.

Trees widely spaced, c. 20ft high, with few lower branches.  Some have leaf or stem characters of C. cayacantheides, but no plant was seen with both.

Dense ivy on ground and up trees.  Much variety of leaf shapes including some "ornamental" ones.  Ivy very patchy in distribution and large areas without it.

Small grassy clearing.  Several pits of various kinds.  One is managed as a reed-field.  Shallow ditches.  Many shallow hollows and hummocks.

Several large willow trees

[12072-12073]

some overthrown.  Mainly S. fragilis.

The site is immediately N. of March station.  Pits are said to be for gravel ballast.  The site is said to have been severeal gardens which were abandoned because of waterlogging.  (note the ivy variation.)

The site has been generally flooded to a depth of about 1 ft.

April 27.  Knapwell Wood.
Public open day; Trust party; recording distribution of primoses and hybrids.  About 35 people turned up.  Wood very wet-standing water in main ride.

Surverying method.  About the peak of flowering for both species.  Primullas generally occur in small fairly discrete patches or colonies.  The plants were recorded colony by colony.  The numbers of infls on each hybrid plant were recorded.  The number of primrose plants

[12074-12075]

Elm Pollard on Knapwell Mound, 43 years since last pollarding.  44 years.

was recorded, but not attempt was made to count primrose flowers.  Thus a colony recorded as 3+2+5P+1+7P means hybrid with 3 infls; hybrid with 2 infls; 5 primrose plants; hybrid with 1 infl; 7 primrose plants.

Plants with at least one "wrong" character are scored as hybrids.  Anthocyanum iin leaves so regarded as a primrose character.  The only other character used are of the infl and flowers.

Scap length is seldom intermediate although a few plants with tall scapes and primrose-like flowers have a few other flowers emerging primrose-like from among the leaves.  "pure" oxlips and sterile plants were disregarded.

The edge of the wood, which is where nearly all the rpimroses and hybrids are, was worked most intensively.  All hybrids visible from rides were recorded and an attempt was made to verify that none grew win the compartments.  It is pssible that a few hyrbids may have been overlooked among the enormous majority of oxlips, but not enough to affect the conclusion that primroses and hybrids occur almost entirely at the edge.

Note on the S. side the figures for inside and outside the wood-bank.  See [SYMBOL]s 4-14.

Also very wet. Fine display of oxlips with no trace of hybridization.  The badgers have been very active recently.

Primroses in the 1968 coppice show a prodigious display: the number of plants is probably unaffected but the flowed per plant have increased substantially.  There is a good display also in the 1969 coppice, with unusually large flowers for reasons unknown.  There is as yet little competing herbaceous vegetation in the 1968 coppice.
